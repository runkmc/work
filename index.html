			<h1>Kevin McGladdery<br/>Developer</h1>
			<p>Hi! I'm Kevin McGladdery. I'm working every day to become a better
			programmer. You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/runkmc">Github</a>, 
			<a href="https://twitter.com/run_kmc">Twitter</a>, and a <a href="http://kmcg.io">bunch of other places</a>.
			Here are some of the things I've been working on:</p>

					<h1>Earthquakr</h1>
					<h2>iOS with Swift</h2>
					<p>An iOS app for finding nearby earthquakes. I learned
					about Cocoapods, MapKit,
					CoreLocation, TDD with Quick/Nimble, storyboards, segues, peek
					and pop with 3D Touch, and parsing JSON from an external
					API.</p>

				<h1>Exercises</h1>
				<h2>Swift, Ruby, Elixir, Clojure, Racket, and Haskell</h2>
				<p>A series of exercises intended to help me grow as a programmer. I'll be implementing different algorithms and data structures while solving problems. I hope to use a variety of languages, including Swift, Ruby, Haskell, Clojure, Racket, Erlang, and Elixir.</p>

					<h1>ColorTools</h1>
					<h2>Cocoapods with Swift</h2>
					<p> A Swift library for working with UIColor. I learned about 
					class extensions in Swift, building my own cocoapod, even more 
					TDD with Quick/Nimble, bitwise operations, and the joy that is 
					UnsafeMutablePointer.</p>

					<h1>Filmstock</h1>
					<h2>iOS with Swift</h2>
					<p>An iOS app for tracking the contents of film cameras. This app was a lot of "firsts" for me; It was my first Swift app and my first app in the App Store.  I learned the basics of Foundation and UIKit, as well as everything involved with successfully submitting an app to the App Store.</p>
